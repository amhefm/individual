Find the Smallest Number in an Array
Overview
This C++ program demonstrates how to find the smallest element in an array using a simple iterative approach. The program defines a function findSmallest() that accepts a vector of integers, iterates through the elements, and returns the smallest number in the array.

Features
Iterative approach: The program uses a loop to traverse the entire array and compare each element.

Minimalistic and clear: The implementation is easy to understand and can be expanded or modified as needed.

Example output: The program displays the smallest number found in the array.
