 Description
This C++ program efficiently finds the smallest element in an array of integers. The implementation is clean, straightforward, and demonstrates fundamental array traversal techniques.

Features
Finds the smallest element in a single pass (O(n) time complexity)

Uses constant space (O(1) space complexity)

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Works with both positive and negative numbers

Handles edge cases implicitly (single-element arrays)

Algorithm Overview
The algorithm works by:

Initializing the smallest number with the first array element

Iterating through each element in the array

Comparing each element with the current smallest

Updating the smallest number when a smaller value is found

Requirements
C++ compiler (C++11 or later recommended)

Standard Template Library (STL)

Usage
Compile the code:

bash
g++ find_smallest.cpp -o find_smallest
Run the executable:

bash
./find_smallest
Example Output
For the input array {5, 2, 9, 1, 7}:

Smallest Number: 1
Time Complexity
O(n) - Single pass through the array

Each element requires exactly 1 comparison

Space Complexity
O(1) - Uses only one additional variable

Edge Cases
Naturally handles single-element arrays

Works with duplicate values

Correctly processes negative numbers

Returns correct result for sorted/unsorted arrays

Possible Extensions
Could be modified to return the index of the smallest element

Could be templatized to work with different numeric types

Could be extended to find both smallest and largest in one pass

Could add input validation for empty arrays
